### Your personality among different jobs

Have you ever wondered how different jobs align with your personality?

This app helps you to explore this.

It does not provide occupational counselling, but it can help you learn about yourself.

If you have lived outside China for ten or more years, please use [this version of the app](https://apps.psych.ut.ee/jobprofiler/).

* you are aged between 18 and 70 years

* each job can be done successfully by very different people
* the results do not show whether you are fit or unfit for particular jobs
* you should disregard the results if they don't make sense to you
* your responses are anonymous, and we will make them publicly available to anyone for research, development or any other use after you click Submit
